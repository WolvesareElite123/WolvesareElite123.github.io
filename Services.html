                <p class="p3">To keep it cheap for you, I simply ask that you pay for your own URL along with any other associated costs. I will work
                    with you to find the <b>cheapest possible solution</b> to host your site.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="p3">My services are charged based on the amount of work I need to do. For example, a database is costly and takes time to set up.
                This would cost more than a normal site. Another example is, designing a site given little input is a lot more difficult than being given
                a rough sketch with preferred colors and images. The more difficult, the more it'd cost.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="p3"><u>Why so cheap?</u> If you contact me, you'd likely find my services significantly cheaper than anything on the market. This is
                due to my only non-negotiable condition - my name and link to this portfolio must be present somewhere. For no fee, I'd have it in small
                text as a 'footer' on your website. For a small fee, I'd place it in the code itself (where users would not look)</p>

                your project needs - does the app need to be iOS-based? android-based? both? Do you have a design in mind? Or would you like me to design
                one for you? Many of these factor into the cost and time it would take to develop your ideal application</p>

                <br>
                <p class="p3">For a project of this scale, the cost would be more than the simple applications and have a different method of payment.
                If the project is determined to need several months to complete, expect constant reports and updates regarding progress and goals for
                each 'sprint'.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="p3">An example of what payment could look like for something in this category could be: a low-cost weekly payment for hours
                worked + one-time pay for the completion/hand over of the project.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="p3">Several factors will dictate larger increases in charges, including: working with other teams, requiring live reports 
                (over video chat or some other platform), requiring work during certain hours, and more.</p>
