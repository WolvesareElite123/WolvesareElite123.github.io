            <p class="p3">Howdy! I'm <b><u>Daniel Wang</u></b>, a software developer from Texas A&M University!</p>
            <br>
            <p class="p3">I come from a heavily software-oriented background with professional experience primarily in Full-Stack Development. Although
            much of this is within the Global Supply Chain realm, I am very eager to expand my work into other fields and learn more.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="p3">Much of my personal interests are primarily in software development within Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and
            Robotics. Thus, I've been working on my own projects within these fields and seek to expand this experience professionally as well!</p>
            <br>
            <p class="p3">I also provide simple web-development services at a low cost to further expand my experience within the field.</p>

            <br>
            <p class="p3">As seen in my <a href="Skills.html">skills</a>, the quote above is something that has been drilled into me since childhood. With 
            a strong emphasis on self-improvement in my free time, I've strived to pick up a variety of projects through the years to learn new skills</p>
            <br>
            <p class="p3">For instance, seeing that my experience was focused in either just front-end or just back-end, I started what was formerly known 
            as 'TOCG' to learn full-stack development. This skill would then carry over and help me pass my interview for Texas A&M systems nearly a year later.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="p3">Although much of my languages are learned on my own, it doesn't mean I lack the fundamentals. Within the University, we focus primarily on a few 
            languages to use and learn important concepts which can then be taken to be applied to others as well.</p>
